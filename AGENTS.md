# Codebase Knowledge Graph (codebase-memory-mcp)

This project uses codebase-memory-mcp to maintain a knowledge graph of the codebase.
ALWAYS prefer MCP graph tools over grep/glob/file-search for code discovery.

## Priority Order
1. `search_graph` — find functions, classes, routes, variables by pattern
2. `trace_path` — trace who calls a function or what it calls
3. `get_code_snippet` — read specific function/class source code
4. `query_graph` — run Cypher queries for complex patterns
5. `get_architecture` — high-level project summary

## When to fall back to grep/glob
- Searching for string literals, error messages, config values
- Searching non-code files (Dockerfiles, shell scripts, configs)
- When MCP tools return insufficient results

## Examples
- Find a handler: `search_graph(name_pattern=".*OrderHandler.*")`
- Who calls it: `trace_path(function_name="OrderHandler", direction="inbound")`
- Read source: `get_code_snippet(qualified_name="pkg/orders.OrderHandler")`

# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
OrcaSlicer’s C++17 sources live in `src/`, split by feature modules and platform adapters. User assets, icons, and printer presets are in `resources/`; translations stay in `localization/`. Tests sit in `tests/`, grouped by domain (`libslic3r/`, `sla_print/`, etc.) with fixtures under `tests/data/`. CMake helpers reside in `cmake/`, and longer references in `doc/` and `SoftFever_doc/`. Automation scripts belong in `scripts/` and `tools/`. Treat everything in `deps/` and `deps_src/` as vendored snapshots—do not modify without mirroring upstream tags.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Use out-of-source builds:
- `cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` configures dependencies and generates build files.
- `cmake --build build --target OrcaSlicer --config Release` compiles the app; add `--parallel` to speed up.
- `cmake --build build --target tests` then `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure` runs automated suites.
Platform helpers such as `build_linux.sh`, `build_release_macos.sh`, and `build_release_vs2022.bat` wrap the same flow with toolchain flags. Use `build_release_macos.sh -sx` when reproducing macOS build issues, and `scripts/DockerBuild.sh` for reproducible container builds.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
`.clang-format` enforces 4-space indents, a 140-column limit, aligned initializers, and brace wrapping for classes and functions. Run `clang-format -i <file>` before committing; the CMake `clang-format` target is available when LLVM tools are on your PATH. Prefer `CamelCase` for classes, `snake_case` for functions and locals, and `SCREAMING_CASE` for constants, matching conventions in `src/`. Keep headers self-contained and align include order with the IWYU pragmas. Use `#pragma once` for headers, RAII/smart pointers where appropriate, and be careful with TBB/shared state.

## Testing Guidelines
Unit tests rely on Catch2 (`tests/catch2/`). Name specs after the component under test—for example `tests/libslic3r/TestPlanarHole.cpp`—and tag long-running cases so `ctest -L fast` remains useful. Cover new algorithms with deterministic fixtures or sample G-code stored in `tests/data/`. Document manual printer validation or regression slicer checks in your PR when automated coverage is insufficient.

## Critical Constraints
- Preserve backward compatibility for `.3mf` project files and printer profiles.
- Changes must work on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Profile/format changes need version migration handling.
- Features gated by options must not affect existing behavior when disabled.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
The history favors concise, sentence-style subject lines with optional issue references, e.g., `Fix grid lines origin for multiple plates (#10724)`. Squash fixups locally before opening a PR. Complete `.github/pull_request_template.md`, include reproduction steps or screenshots for UI changes, and mention impacted presets or translations. Link issues via `Closes #NNNN` when applicable, and call out dependency bumps or profile migrations for maintainer review.

## Upstream Sync Notes
When merging or rebasing from `upstream`, preserve fork-specific build and release customizations instead of taking upstream changes blindly. Pay extra attention to `.github/workflows/**`, `build_release_macos.sh`, Windows/Linux release scripts, release tags, artifact naming, signing/notarization steps, fork-only publishing logic, BBL Connect integration, Peter's Edition branding, dynamic accent/theme changes, and filament dropdown/search UX. After resolving merge conflicts from upstream, explicitly re-check that PE build fixes and release workflow changes are still present before considering the sync complete.

## Security & Configuration Tips
Follow `SECURITY.md` for vulnerability reporting. Keep API tokens and printer credentials out of tracked configs; use `sandboxes/` for experimental settings. When touching third-party code in `deps_src/`, record the upstream commit or release in your PR description and run the relevant platform build script to confirm integration.
